# Introduction

The Highway Bus Management System facilitates passengers in accessing bus timings, availability, delays, ticket prices, live locations, lost item details, found item details, ticket reservations, and luggage reservations through a mobile application. This system stands apart from others due to its unique feature that allows passengers to provide real-time location updates.

Authorities can update the bus schedule using the web application CRUD operation. Before logging in to the CRUD operation, authorities must log in or sign up. If the signup is successful, a verification email will be sent to the given email address.
